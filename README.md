## SITUATION

For Veteran's Day, the challenge is to tell the veteran story by using demographic data provided by the VetPop2020 dataset. The VetPop2020 dataset was provided by the VA's [National Center for Veterans Analysis and Statistics](https://www.va.gov/vetdata/veteran_population.asp).

## MISSION

Your mission is to review the data and the [dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ethan.lang/viz/HunterSevenFoundation-NurseSurvey/HunterSevenFoundation-NurseSurvey) and attempt to do one of two things (or even both):

* If you can see something in the data that is worth telling that was not told, tell it in a dashboard!
* If you think there is another way to visually tell the story that Ethan highlighted, reviz it!

## EXECUTION

The source data is located [here.](https://github.com/VeteransData/HunterSeven/raw/main/nurse_survey/NurseSurvey.xlsx)

You can use any tools at your disposal. The final product should be published as a dashboard to Tableau Public with the following hashtag in the details:

**&#35;H7_NURSE_CHALLENGE**
 


## ADMINISTRATION

If you run into any issues or want to discuss the challenge, message us in Slack!

## COMMAND & SIGNAL

Once published, post to Twitter and/or LinkedIn with that same hashtag (#H7_NURSE_CHALLENGE) and @mention any of the Veterans Advocacy TUG Leads.
