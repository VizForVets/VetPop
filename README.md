## SITUATION

Ethan Lang's deep dive into the nurse survey data provided by the Hunter Seven Foundation had a key finding: **"Lack of education on veteran-related illnesses and risks leads to misdiagnosis or improper preventative care in the private healthcare industry."**

Essentially, a large share of veterans seeks all their medical are outside of the walls of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Because of this, nurses in the private sector may not have the knowledge to address all of the unique needs of the veterans community, like traumatic brain injury and exposure to toxins.

This is an important point to make, but there may be others to make given all the data that were provided by Hunter Seven.

## MISSION

Your mission is to review the data and the [dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ethan.lang/viz/HunterSevenFoundation-NurseSurvey/HunterSevenFoundation-NurseSurvey) and attempt to do one of two things (or even both):

* If you can see something in the data that is worth telling that was not told, tell it in a dashboard!
* If you think there is another way to visually tell the story that Ethan highlighted, reviz it!

## EXECUTION

The source data is located [here.](https://github.com/VeteransData/HunterSeven/raw/main/nurse_survey/NurseSurvey.xlsx)

You can use any tools at your disposal. The final product should be published as a dashboard to Tableau Public with the following hashtag in the details:

**&#35;H7_NURSE_CHALLENGE**
 


## ADMINISTRATION

If you run into any issues or want to discuss the challenge, message us in Slack!

## COMMAND & SIGNAL

Once published, post to Twitter and/or LinkedIn with that same hashtag (#H7_NURSE_CHALLENGE) and @mention any of the Veterans Advocacy TUG Leads.
