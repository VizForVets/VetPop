## SITUATION

The Veteran Population Model (aka VetPop) is an official population projection for veterans in the United States. It provides demographic data projections for a variety of characteristics such as age, gender, period of service, and race/ethnicity. The VetPop2020 dataset was provided by the VA's [National Center for Veterans Analysis and Statistics](https://www.va.gov/vetdata/veteran_population.asp).

Find out more [here](https://www.va.gov/vetdata/docs/Demographics/New_Vetpop_Model/VetPop2020_A_Brief_Description.pdf).

## MISSION

For Veteran's Day, the challenge is to tell the veteran story by using demographic data provided by the VetPop2020 dataset. 

## EXECUTION

The source data is located in this [repository](https://github.com/VizForVets/VetPop/raw/main/VetPop_2020.xlsx). Note: Data was updated 10.19.2022 due to some truncation happening from an API previously.

You can use any tools at your disposal. The final product should be published as a dashboard to Tableau Public with the following hashtag in the details:

**&#35;VIZFORVETS**
 

## ADMINISTRATION

If you run into any issues or want to discuss the challenge, message us in Slack!

## COMMAND & SIGNAL

Once published, post to Twitter and/or LinkedIn with that same hashtag (#VIZFORVETS) and @mention any of the Veterans Advocacy TUG Leads.
