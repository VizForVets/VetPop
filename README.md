## SITUATION

The Veteran Population Model (aka VetPop) is an official population projection for veterans in the United States. It provides demographic data projections for a variety of characteristics such as age, gender, period of service, and race/ethnicity. The VetPop2020 dataset was provided by the VA's [National Center for Veterans Analysis and Statistics](https://www.va.gov/vetdata/veteran_population.asp).
